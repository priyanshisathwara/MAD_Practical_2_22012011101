AIM : Create Android Application to demonstrate functions of Activity Life Cycle and Basic UI.

About : 
The "Activity Lifecycle Demo" Android app is a simple application designed to demonstrate Android's activity lifecycle functions alongside basic UI elements. 
The app consists of two activities with TextViews, Buttons, and an optional EditText, allowing users to navigate between screens. Each lifecycle method 
(like onCreate, onStart, onResume, etc.) is overridden to log messages in Logcat, making it easy to observe the transitions as the app's state changes. 
Additionally, the app illustrates state management by saving and restoring data using onSaveInstanceState and onRestoreInstanceState, providing a hands-on learning experience of 
activity transitions and UI interactions in Android development.
